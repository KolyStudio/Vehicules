                    There are certain situations where only a partial refund
                    will be given: (if applicable)
                    <br />
                    <br />* Any item that is not in its original condition, is
                    damaged or has some parts missing for reasons that are not
                    due to an error on our part.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Once we have received and inspected the returned item, we
                    will send you an email to confirm that we have received it.
                    We will also inform you of our decision on whether to
                    approve or reject your refund request.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    If you have not yet received your refund, please check your
                    bank account again first.

                    <br />
                    Next, contact your credit card company as there may be a
                    delay before your refund is officially posted.

                    <br />

                    required before a refund is posted.

                    If the returned item was identified as a gift at the time of
                    purchase and was sent directly to you, you will receive a
                    gift credit equal to the value of your return. Once we

                    purchase, or if the gift giver preferred to receive the item
                    first and give it to you later, we will send a refund to the
                    gift giver and they will know that you returned the item.
                    Depending on where you live, the time it takes to receive
                    your exchanged product may vary.
