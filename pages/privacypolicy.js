                    <br />
                    When you browse our store, we also automatically receive the

                    allows us to obtain more details about the browser and

                    When you provide us with your personal information to

                    If we ask you to provide your personal information for any

                    Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the
                    online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our
                    services and products to you.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Your data is stored in Shopify&apos;s data storage system
                    and databases, and in the general Shopify application. Your
                    data is kept on a secure server protected by a firewall.

                  <h1 className='font-bold'>Payment:</h1>
                  <p>
                    If you make your purchase through a direct payment gateway,
                    in that case Shopify will store your credit card
                    information. This information is encrypted in accordance
                    with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
                    PCI-DSS. Your purchase transaction information is retained
                    for as long as necessary to complete your order. Once your
                    order is finalized, your purchase transaction information is
                    deleted.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    All direct payment gateways are PCI-DSS compliant, managed
                    by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
                    effort of companies such as Visa, MasterCard, American
                    Express and Discover.

                    <br />
                    PCI-DSS requirements ensure the secure processing of credit
                    card data by our store and its service providers.

                    ARTICLE 5 - SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES
                  </h1>
                  <p>
                    Generally, the third-party providers we use will only
                    collect, use and disclose your information to the extent
                    necessary to perform the services they provide to us.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    However, some third party service providers, such as payment
                    gateways and other payment transaction processors, have
                    their own privacy policies regarding the information we are
                    required to provide to them for your purchase transactions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    With respect to these providers, we recommend that you read
                    their privacy policies carefully so that you can understand
                    how they will handle your personal information.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Keep in mind that some suppliers may be located or have
                    facilities located in a different jurisdiction than you or
                    us. So if you decide to proceed with a transaction that
                    requires the services of a third party supplier, then your
                    information may be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction
                    in which that supplier is located or the jurisdiction in
                    which its facilities are located.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    For example, if you are located in Canada and your
                    transaction is processed through a payment gateway located
                    in the United States, your information used to complete the
                    transaction may be disclosed under United States law,
                    including the Patriot Act.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Once you leave our store site or are redirected to a third
                    party website or application, you are no longer governed by
                    this Privacy Policy or our website&apos;s Terms and

                    transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100%
                    secure, we follow all the requirements of the PCI-DSS and
